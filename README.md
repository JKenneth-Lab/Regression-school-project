# 📘 Regression Line Calculator (GUI Edition)

A school project built with Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and CustomTkinter to calculate and visualize Linear 
and Polynomial Regression. This tool uses a GUI for a more intuitive experience, allowing users to enter data, 
view solution steps, generate graphs, and interact with tables.

# Project Description
This application reads numerical data (typically x and y values), computes the regression line equation.

## Where:

m is the slope

b is the y-intercept

## The tool also provides:

Scatter plot visualization

Calculation of R-squared value 

Prediction based on the regression line


# Features

📈 Supports Linear and Polynomial Regression (degree 2)

🖼️ Interactive GUI built with CustomTkinter

📊 Dynamic Graphs using Matplotlib (dark mode supported)

📋 Tabular data view using Pandas + Treeview Table

📚 Full step-by-step solving explanation for both regression modes

🎵 Background music support using pygame

🖼️ Animated splash screen


# Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sympy customtkinter pygame pillow CTkMessagebox


# Notes

Some files (images, GIFs, large assets) might not be included in the ZIP/online upload due to size limitations.

If some graphs or buttons don't work, check that all dependencies are installed.

Ensure that any required images/ (e.g., img1, rimg1, etc.) are in the correct folder.
